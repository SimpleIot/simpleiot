Rule Condition Implementation Notes

- Sampling limited to 10 seconds (same as scheduler)
- Each condition queries samples from the sliding sample window
	- Window - window duration in seconds
		- Maybe error if window length is shorter than 1 minute?
	- WindowPercent - % of points in the window that must match condition
		criteria to activate the condition
	- WindowEvaluate - duration between Influx queries
		- Maybe error if lower than 10 seconds?
- Query
	- Start: Minimum(last sample time, now - Window duration)
	- Stop: now
	- TagFilters: node.id, point type, point key from condition
	- AggregateWindow: nil
- Set last sample time to now
- Count number of points that meet Condition criteria
- If count / total >= WindowPercent, set active flag; otherwise, clear it
- Write point containing query / processing time for condition
