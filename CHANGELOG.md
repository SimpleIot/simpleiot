## [Unreleased]

## [[0.0.37] - 2021-10-26](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases/tag/v0.0.37)

- fix issue with setup where you sometimes get error: elm: Text file busy
- cleanup simpleiot.Start() so it actually returns

## [[0.0.36] - 2021-10-26](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases/tag/v0.0.36)

- rename `db` package to `store`
- factor out siot server startup code into simpleiot package
- change `siot_run` in `envsetup.sh` to `go build` instead of `go run`

## [[0.0.35] - 2021-10-04](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases/tag/v0.0.35)

- add placeholders for some UI forms
- add disable for Modbus and Modbus client nodes (#250)
- clean up locking issues and simplify DB code

## [[0.0.34] - 2021-09-08](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases/tag/v0.0.34)

- handle audio playback where file bitrate does not match default of audio
  device (#240)
- support rule actions that trigger when rule goes inactive (instead of active).
  This allows a rule to do something with the run goes active as well as
  inactive and in some cases saves us from writing two rules (#241).
- re-enable indexes on edge up/down fields (#219)
- add point min/max to NATS packets
- add NATS api metrics (as points to root device node) (#244)
- don't color root node grey for now
- update influxdb client to 2.5.0
- switch to async influx DB API (batches data, retries, etc)
- implement caching of nodes and edges to speed up read access
- add point processing cycle time and nats client pending messages metrics
- modbus loglevel 1 only prints errors, 2 now prints transactions
- web UI auth expires in 24hr instead of 30m -- still not ideal, but one step at
  a time (#249)
- update front tar package to fix security warnings

## [[0.0.33] - 2021-08-12](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases/tag/v0.0.33)

- fix frontend build issue with last two releases
- add rule audio playback action functionality for Linux (requires alsa-utils)
- fix various bugs with rule schedule condition functionality
- all using rule active in rule conditions (allows chaining rules)
- improve rule condition processing to process all conditions/points rather than
  just first match
- implement schedule conditions for rules
- switch from github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go to github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4
- update frontend dependencies to satisify github security checks

## [[0.0.32] - 2021-08-11](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases/tag/v0.0.32)

- DO NOT USE, FRONTEND BUILD ISSUE

## [[0.0.31] - 2021-08-10](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases/tag/v0.0.31)

- DO NOT USE, FRONTEND BUILD ISSUE

## [[0.0.30] - 2021-07-22](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases/tag/v0.0.30)

- fix using SIOT_AUTH_TOKEN for -logNats command line option
- upgrade to NATS 2.2.2. Increases SIOT binary by about 2MB (uncompressed), 1MB
  (compressed)
- disable badger for now -- can be re-enabled in db/genji.go. Bolt seems to work
  better for the current SIOT use cases and Badger just adds bloat to the
  binary.
- implement upstream synronization support
  [#109](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/issues/109)
- update to Genji v0.13.0

## [[0.0.29] - 2021-04-22](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases/tag/v0.0.29)

## [[0.0.27] - 2021-04-15](https://github.com/simpleiot/simpleiot/releases/tag/v0.0.27)
